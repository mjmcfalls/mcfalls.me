I have moved my site over to Jekyll; soon, I will start posting more about things I am working on in my homelab or home automation area. There might be some posts regarding interesting technology and/or innovations at work, but we will have to see what arises on that front.

Currently, this Jekyll site is being hosted on AWS and being built when changes are pushed to Github.
