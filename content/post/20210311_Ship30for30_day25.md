**Get Out Of Your Own Way**  
Amy Cuddy writer of "Presence" said, "Sometimes you have to get out of the way of yourself so you can be yourself."  

To build a new path for ourselves, we have to root out the limiting beliefs holding us back, then let go of them, or change the beliefs into something to aid us.  

Rooting out and changing our limiting beliefs is difficult. We have to have a goal we are working toward, then the hard part. We have to dispassionately peer into ourselves to examine what actions and beliefs we hold that are helping us move toward our goal, and what is holding us back.  

We need courage and self-confidence to objectively look at our actions and beliefs to determine what is holding us back. Introspection is not an easy action. There are better-qualified people to assist with redefining limiting beliefs.  

The way I talk and the timbre of my voice has always been a limiting belief for me. I felt people wouldn't take me seriously or listen to me due to this belief. I learned by reinventing myself, by getting out of my own way, those who define me through by who I talk limit themselves. 

We need to look at the difference between who we believe we are, who we are, and who we want to be, then scrape away the negative bits holding us back, and the bits we can't remove, accept as part of us.
