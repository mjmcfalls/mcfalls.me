That One Who Opens Up Possibilities
I've met several people, who have influenced the course of my life -- many positively, one extremely negatively.   

There is one person in the last few years whose impact completely changed my life. I'm not going to specifically name them, because I don't want to violate their privacy. If they read this, they'll know who they are.   

They taught me how kindness, and empathy, when paired with open communication can have a huge impact on a life's course. 

The space to explore and talk through an on-going issue, while placing huge undeserved confidence in my skills helped me to see a future where I could be more than I was, and currently am. They started a hugely negative short-term action to put me in a better place in the long term. I can't say many have been willing to do such a thing.  

We can treat others how they need to be treated, understand each other's issues, and problems while working toward a common goal and individual goals. It doesn't have to a win-lose situation, where the biggest ego or most stubborn wins.  

I'm immeasurably grateful for their support provided the last few years, and for openly sharing their knowledge and kindness. I can't say how things would have turned out without their support.  

We never know the impact of our words and actions on the course of someone's life. Let's do our best to make our words kind and empathic, and work on understanding those around us better.
