**TITLE**
How do we work with someone we haven't been able to build trust with and haven't been able to build a socially accepted way to agree and disagree?

These are adversaries and usually either won't cooperate or have a different vision.  

These are those emotionally and socially hard connections to build.  Work with them by trying to understand where they are coming from, and what they want to achieve.  When starting a project or task with them, especially if you don't trust them, ask upfront what they want.  For example, you could ask, in a curious tone, "Tell me what you want to achieve on this project."

Be curious about what they want to accomplish and viewpoints to open up the possibility of building the relationship and turning them into an ally.  Curiosity will help verify their story is true, and from there help build understanding.  Over time, the understanding can turn into trust. 

From experience, keep track of how much energy is being put into the relationship, and how the relationship is changing.  If you're consistently putting energy into building the relationship, but the relationship is not getting better or is getting worse, then it's time for self-reflection.  

If the relationship feels like you're talking to a black hole, then the time has come to let go of the relationship, and stop putting energy into it. 

We will always run across people, for whatever reason, who are immovable.  The quicker we figure out the immovable people, the quicker we can put our energy into beneficial relationships.
