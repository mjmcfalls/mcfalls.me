**Where are you dropping your anchor?**

Anchoring is the cognitive tendency to rely on and make decisions off the first piece of information we collect or are given on an idea, person, or thing.

**We are vulnerable to anchoring.**

**We anchor ourselves and others.**

Anchors can be positive or negative.  A positive anchor could be something as simple as saying a person is awesome. A negative anchor can be saying someone isn't smart.  We see anchoring every day while shopping. Sales, where the original price is shown with the lower price, is a great example of anchoring. The store is setting the anchor at the original price, then showing how much cheaper the item is with the sale price.

**As leaders need to be careful where, when, and how we anchor.**

For example, I had a team lead try to negatively anchor their negative opinion of a peer on me. I was brushed off their opinion because I had not met this other person. 

The next day I had a couple of minutes at the beginning of a meeting to talk with the negatively anchored person. I noticed after a minute I was leaning toward the anchor set by the team lead, even though I didn't have appropriate information to support the anchor. Now I have an uphill battle to undo the negative anchor and learn about the other person.

As parents, friends, leaders, significant others, **we want to take care in how we anchor our thoughts and opinions on others, especially in regards to other people.**
