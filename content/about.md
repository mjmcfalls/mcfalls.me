I'm Matthew!  
I'm a System Engineer/Devops Engineer with interests in System Administration, System Engineering, Cloud Enginnering, Devops, and development.  Outside of work, I'm a wanna-be musician, avid reader, homelab nerd, and all around geek.  I believe learning doesn't stop after school, and love to learn new technologies, learn new life skills, and learn about anything that happens to catch my attention.
